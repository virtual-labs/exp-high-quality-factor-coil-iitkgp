      "question": "The four arms of the Hay Bridge, are arranged as follows. AB: consists with unknown impedance. BC: non-inductive resistor of 16800 `&#x2126;`. CD: consists of non-inductive resistor of 950 `&#x2126;` in series with a standard capacitor of 1.57 uF. DA:non-inductive resistor of 1000 `&#x2126;`.The supply frequency is 50 Hz.
