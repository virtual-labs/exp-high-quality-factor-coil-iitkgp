## Procedure

 ![Measurement of Self Inductance of High Quality Factor Coil by Hay's Bridge](images/hay_ckt.jpg)

1. Connect all the components and the air cored coil as shown in the Fig. 2.
2. Set the voltage at a convenient value (say, V=3V) . Set  the resistances  R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>  at a convenient value and obtain the balance by varying R<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>.
3. Decide the ranges for R<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>  through which they can varied until milivoltmeter (mV) value would be zero.
4. Repeat the procedure with different values of the product R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>3</sub> and decide upon readings that permit maximum accuracy for the measurement.
