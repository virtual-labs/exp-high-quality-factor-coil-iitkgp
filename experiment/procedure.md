## Procedure

- ![Measurement of Self Inductance of High Quality Factor Coil by Hay's Bridge](images/hay_ckt.jpg)
- Connect all the components and the air cored coil as shown in the Fig. 2.
- Set the voltage at a convenient value (say, V=3V) . Set  the resistances  R2, and R3  at a convenient value and obtain the balance by varying R4 and C4.
- Decide the ranges for R4 and C4  through which they can varied until milivoltmeter (mV) value would be zero.
- Repeat the procedure with different values of the product R2R3 and decide upon readings that permit maximum accuracy for the measurement.
